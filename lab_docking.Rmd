Docking is the prediction the structure of complexes such as: Protein-Ligand, Protein-Protein, Protein-NA, NA-Ligand, NA-NA.

In order for these complexes to be formed, their integrants need to recognize each other in a selective and dynamic way, this is achieved by structural complementarity.

This prediction might be useful to:
- Understanding interactions, roles of specific amino acids, design of mutations and  changes of activity.
- Comparison of affinities of different molecules
- Drug design


# Docking types & strategy

Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between unbound and bound structures.

- Bound vs Unbound
  - Bound: goal is to reproduce a known complex where the starting coordinates of the individual molecules are taken from the crystal of the complex
  - Unbound: significantly more difficult problem, the starting coordinates are taken from the unbound molecules

Early algorithms in order to be faster assumed that docked molecules do not change conformations, treating them as rigid bodies.

- Flexible vs Rigid
  - Rigid: procedures that perform rigid body search
  - Felxible: procedures that consider possible conformational changes (protein flexibility)

Whether the binding site of molecules is known or not the search space will vary. Global docking ismore demanding in terms of computational time and the results are less accurate.

- Global vs Local
  - Global: search for the location of the binding site and a search to figure out the exact  orientation of the ligand in the binding site.
  - Local: if binding site is known, we just need to orient the ligand in the binding site.

## Strategy

- Protein representation
- Search method
- Scoring method
- Refinement?
